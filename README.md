News Authenticity Classifier

Overview

The News Authenticity Classifier is an AI-powered tool designed to classify news articles as either real (credible) or fake (misleading). By leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this model analyzes the content of news articles to determine their authenticity. This project aims to help users identify misleading or false news in order to promote a more informed and responsible consumption of information.

Features

Text Classification: Classifies news articles into two categories: real or fake.
NLP-based Model: Built using advanced natural language processing algorithms, including deep learning models.
Real-time Prediction: Allows users to input a news article and get a prediction on its authenticity.
Installation
To get started with the News Authenticity Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-authenticity-classifier.git
cd news-authenticity-classifier

2. Install the dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download pre-trained models
Pre-trained models for text classification can be downloaded automatically when the application is run for the first time. Alternatively, you can manually download the model weights from [this link] and place them in the /models directory.

Usage
1. Run the Application
To run the classification model and test it on your news articles:

bash
Copy
python app.py
This will start a simple command-line interface or web app (based on your configuration), where you can input a news article and receive a prediction.

2. Input a News Article
Paste the text of the article you want to verify into the prompt, and the model will output whether it is likely to be real or fake.

Model Architecture
This project uses a combination of the following:

Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning and tokenization using libraries like NLTK and spaCy.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorizer or Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) for transforming the raw text into numerical features.
Modeling: A machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning models like LSTM or BERT fine-tuned for text classification tasks.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to evaluate the performance of the model on a validation dataset.
Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available datasets like the LIAR dataset, which consists of news headlines and articles labeled as either true or false. The dataset is split into training and validation sets for fine-tuning and model evaluation.

Disclaimer

This project does not guarantee 100% accuracy in classifying news articles. The goal is to provide users with an additional tool to help critically assess the authenticity of news, but it should not be relied upon as the sole source of truth. Always cross-check with trusted sources.
